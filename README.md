Hello everyone!

This is an American Energy Market Regulator Case Study that I learned about during my Springboard Data Analytics Career Track. Here, I was able to explore how the AEMR identifies key factors (energy providers) responsible for the majority of Energy Loss and Energy stability in 2016-2017 using my SQL skills. I utilized all my SQL skills, including:

1. **Querying Data**: The ability to write SQL queries to retrieve specific information from databases is fundamental. This includes using SELECT statements to filter, sort, and aggregate data.

2. **Data Manipulation**: Understanding how to manipulate data using SQL functions such as JOIN, UNION, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY is essential for performing complex analyses.

3. **Data Filtering and Selection**: Knowing how to filter data using WHERE clauses to extract relevant information based on specific criteria is crucial for data analysis tasks.

4. **Data Aggregation**: Being able to aggregate data using functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, and MIN is important for generating summaries and insights from large datasets.

5. **Data Transformation**: Familiarity with techniques for transforming data, such as converting data types, handling NULL values, and creating calculated fields, is necessary for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.

6. **Subqueries**: Understanding how to use subqueries to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts and perform nested queries is valuable for advanced data analysis tasks.
